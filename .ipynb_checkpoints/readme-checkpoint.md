## 📊 House Pricing Data Analysis

This repository contains a structured collection of folders and Jupyter notebooks focused on the analysis of house pricing data.

The main purpose of this project is educational. It is designed to support continuous learning and skill development in data analysis by working with real-world datasets related to housing prices.

Throughout this repository, different data analysis techniques are applied, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature understanding, data visualization, and basic statistical analysis. The notebooks aim to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation using Python and common data analysis libraries.

This project also serves as a training ground to experiment with new approaches, test ideas, and gradually improve analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. It is intended to evolve over time as more techniques, experiments, and insights are added.

Overall, this repository represents a hands-on learning journey focused on strengthening data analysis fundamentals and building a solid foundation for future machine learning projects.
